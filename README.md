## INTRODUCTION
Datacom is an Information Technology services company, offering management and consulting, cloud services, ITO, data center services, custom software development and payroll services. Datacom is the largest technology company in New Zealand. This project focuses on conducting a risk assessment for the organisation, define the context, assess their risk matrix and identify potential risk scenarios.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The client has a fence around the perimeter of its property and a padlock on its entrance gate to prevent unauthorised access. However, the leadership team is concerned about potential risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of its information and systems. They require a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in their system or network.

## OBJECTIVES
- The goal of the risk assessment is to help the client prioritise and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate and minimise risks. This will ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information and systems, as well as protect their reputation and financial resources.

## TASKS
- Identify the assets that need to be protected. This could include sensitive information, customer data, financial information or any other critical assets that are important to the client.
- Define the likelihood, consequence and risk rating for each potential risk scenario (Define the risk matrix).
- Identify specific risks that the client needs to protect their assets from. i.e, cyberattack, natural disaster or employee negligence.
- Assess risk rating for each risk scenario â€“ Calculate the inherent risk rating for each scenario, assuming there are no measures in place to reduce the risk (without fence and padlock in place).
- Assess risk levels for each risk scenario with additional measures:**
- Create a risk assessment report for the client that summarises the risk assessment findings**

## TOOLS
- Microsoft Excel Software on Windows or MacOS
- Risk Assessment Template

## DEFINITIONS
- **Risk assessment: a process of identifying potential risks, analysing their likelihood and potential impact, and implementing measures to mitigate those risks.**
- **Risk position: The level of risk that an organisation faces.**
- **Risk matrix: A tool used to assess and evaluate risks based on the likelihood and consequence of a risk event occurring.**
- **Likelihood: The probability of a risk event occurring.**
- **Consequence: The severity of the potential impact of a risk event.**
- **Risk rating: A measure of the overall risk posed by a scenario, calculated by multiplying the likelihood and consequence.**
- **Inherent risk rating: The risk rating of a scenario without any measures in place to reduce the risk.**
- **Current risk rating: The risk rating of a scenario with existing measures in place to reduce the risk.**
- **Target risk rating: The desired risk rating of a scenario with additional measures put in place to further reduce the risk.**
- **Risk assessment report: A report that summarises the risk assessment findings, the risk mitigation strategy, and any recommended measures for implementation.**
- **Avoid risk: Eliminate or forego risk.**
- **Treat risk: reduce the likelihood or impact of risk.**
- **Transfer risk: assign or move the risk to a third party.**
- **Accept risk: acknowledge the risk and choose not to resolve, transfer or mitigate.**

## ASSET INVENTORY
Based on the problem statement, below is a list of assets  to protect
- **Sensitive Information: Intellectual property, internal communications, and strategic plans.**
