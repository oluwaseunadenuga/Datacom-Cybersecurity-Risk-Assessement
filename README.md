## Introduction
Datacom is an Information Technology services company, offering management and consulting, cloud services, ITO, data center services, custom software development and payroll services. Datacom is the largest technology company in New Zealand. This project focuses on conducting a risk assessment for the organisation, define the context, assess their risk matrix and identify potential risk scenarios.

## Problem Statement
The client has a fence around the perimeter of its property and a padlock on its entrance gate to prevent unauthorised access. However, the leadership team is concerned about potential risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of its information and systems. They require a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in their system or network.

## Objectives
- The goal of the risk assessment is to help the client prioritise and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate and minimise risks. This will ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information and systems, as well as protect their reputation and financial resources.

## Tasks
- Identify the assets that need to be protected. This could include sensitive information, customer data, financial information or any other critical assets that are important to the client.
- Define the likelihood, consequence and risk rating for each potential risk scenario (Define the risk matrix).
- Identify specific risks that the client needs to protect their assets from. i.e, cyberattack, natural disaster or employee negligence.
- Assess risk rating for each risk scenario â€“ Calculate the inherent risk rating for each scenario, assuming there are no measures in place to reduce the risk (without fence and padlock in place).
- Assess risk levels for each risk scenario with additional measures:**
- Create a risk assessment report for the client that summarises the risk assessment findings**

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel Software on Windows or MacOS
- Risk Assessment Template

## Definitions
- **Risk assessment: a process of identifying potential risks, analysing their likelihood and potential impact, and implementing measures to mitigate those risks.**
- **Risk position: The level of risk that an organisation faces.**
- **Risk matrix: A tool used to assess and evaluate risks based on the likelihood and consequence of a risk event occurring.**
- **Likelihood: The probability of a risk event occurring.**
- **Consequence: The severity of the potential impact of a risk event.**
- **Risk rating: A measure of the overall risk posed by a scenario, calculated by multiplying the likelihood and consequence.**
- **Inherent risk rating: The risk rating of a scenario without any measures in place to reduce the risk.**
- **Current risk rating: The risk rating of a scenario with existing measures in place to reduce the risk.**
- **Target risk rating: The desired risk rating of a scenario with additional measures put in place to further reduce the risk.**
- **Risk assessment report: A report that summarises the risk assessment findings, the risk mitigation strategy, and any recommended measures for implementation.**
- **Avoid risk: Eliminate or forego risk.**
- **Treat risk: reduce the likelihood or impact of risk.**
- **Transfer risk: assign or move the risk to a third party.**
- **Accept risk: acknowledge the risk and choose not to resolve, transfer or mitigate.**

## Identification of Critical Assets
Based on the problem statement, the following critical assets were identified as requiring protection. The compromise of these assets could lead to significant operational, financial, and reputational damage to the organisation.
- **Confidential Customer Data: Personal and sensitive information belonging to customers.**
- Sensitive Information: Intellectual property, internal communications, and strategic plans.**
- **Proprietary Business Information: Internal data that provides a competitive advantage.**
- **Financial Information: Company financial records, transaction data, and banking details.**
- **Intellectual Property: Patents, trade secrets, designs, and proprietary software.**
- Customer Data: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial records.** 
- ** Physical Infrastructure & Equipment: Servers, network hardware, and other critical physical assets.**

## LIKELY RISKS & INHERENT RISK RATING
- **Cyberattack**
- **Natural Disaster**
- **Employee Negligence**
- **Data Breach**
- **Infrastructure compromise**
- **Supply chain attack**

## 4.0 Risk Matrix and Recommendations

<img width="842" height="295" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7450c7da-a8e7-41f8-8ca8-2a3aeda630a8" />

## Risk Assessment Summary & Recommendations

## Executive Summary:
This risk assessment has identified several critical risks, with Data Breach and Cyber Attack posing the most significant inherent threat to the organisation. However, the analysis demonstrates that with the implementation of a combination of existing and proposed additional security controls, these risks can be reduced to manageable levels. The overall cybersecurity posture can be significantly strengthened, aligning with industry best practices.

**Key Findings:**
1.**Top Threats**: Cyber attacks targeting data and infrastructure are the most probable and impactful threats.
2.**Human Factor:** Employee negligence remains a notable risk, but it can be effectively mitigated through training and technical controls.
3.**External Dependencies:** Supply chain and vendor-related risks require ongoing management and vigilance.
4.	**Effectiveness of Controls:** The proposed technical controls (e.g., MFA, ZTA, DLP, EDR) are rated as "Excellent" or "Good" and will provide substantial risk reduction.

## Prioritised Recommendations:

1.	**Immediate Action (High Priority):**
- **Address Data Breach Risk (R04): Prioritise the implementation of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools and comprehensive encryption for data at rest and in transit.**
- **Strengthen Access Security (R01, R03): Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems and implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce the principle of least privilege..**

2.**	Medium-Term Initiatives (Medium Priority):**
- **Enhance Monitoring and Response (R01, R04, R05): Advance the SIEM capabilities and deploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions for superior threat detection and response.**
- **Implement Zero Trust (R06): Begin the architectural shift towards a Zero Trust Model to protect against supply chain and lateral movement attacks.**
- **Validate Security Posture (R01, R05): Conduct regular penetration testing and red/blue team exercises to proactively find and fix weaknesses..**

3.	Ongoing Programs (Continuous Priority):
- **Continuous Vulnerability Management (R05): Implement a program for continuous scanning and patching of systems.**
- **Security Awareness Training (R01, R03): Maintain regular, engaging training to combat employee negligence and phishing.**
- **Vendor Risk Management (R06): Formalise vendor security assessments and introduce continuous monitoring.**

By following these recommendations, the organisation can effectively transition from a reactive to a proactive security stance, significantly reducing its overall risk profile and enhancing its resilience against cyber threats.
