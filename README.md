## INTRODUCTION
Datacom is an Information Technology services company, offering management and consulting, cloud services, ITO, data center services, custom software development and payroll services. Datacom is the largest technology company in New Zealand. This project focuses on conducting a risk assessment for the organisation, define the context, assess their risk matrix and identify potential risk scenarios.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The client has a fence around the perimeter of its property and a padlock on its entrance gate to prevent unauthorised access. However, the leadership team is concerned about potential risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of its information and systems. They require a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in their system or network.

## OBJECTIVES
- The goal of the risk assessment is to help the client prioritise and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate and minimise risks. This will ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information and systems, as well as protect their reputation and financial resources.

## TASKS
- Identify the assets that need to be protected. This could include sensitive information, customer data, financial information or any other critical assets that are important to the client.
- Define the likelihood, consequence and risk rating for each potential risk scenario (Define the risk matrix).
- Identify specific risks that the client needs to protect their assets from. i.e, cyberattack, natural disaster or employee negligence.
- Assess risk rating for each risk scenario – Calculate the inherent risk rating for each scenario, assuming there are no measures in place to reduce the risk (without fence and padlock in place).
- Assess risk levels for each risk scenario with additional measures:**
- Create a risk assessment report for the client that summarises the risk assessment findings**

## TOOLS
- Microsoft Excel Software on Windows or MacOS
- Risk Assessment Template

## DEFINITIONS
- **Risk assessment: a process of identifying potential risks, analysing their likelihood and potential impact, and implementing measures to mitigate those risks.**
- **Risk position: The level of risk that an organisation faces.**
- **Risk matrix: A tool used to assess and evaluate risks based on the likelihood and consequence of a risk event occurring.**
- **Likelihood: The probability of a risk event occurring.**
- **Consequence: The severity of the potential impact of a risk event.**
- **Risk rating: A measure of the overall risk posed by a scenario, calculated by multiplying the likelihood and consequence.**
- **Inherent risk rating: The risk rating of a scenario without any measures in place to reduce the risk.**
- **Current risk rating: The risk rating of a scenario with existing measures in place to reduce the risk.**
- **Target risk rating: The desired risk rating of a scenario with additional measures put in place to further reduce the risk.**
- **Risk assessment report: A report that summarises the risk assessment findings, the risk mitigation strategy, and any recommended measures for implementation.**
- **Avoid risk: Eliminate or forego risk.**
- **Treat risk: reduce the likelihood or impact of risk.**
- **Transfer risk: assign or move the risk to a third party.**
- **Accept risk: acknowledge the risk and choose not to resolve, transfer or mitigate.**


## ASSET INVENTORY
Based on the problem statement, below is a list of assets  to protect
- **Sensitive Information: Intellectual property, internal communications, and strategic plans.**
- **Customer Data: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial records.** 
- **Datacom Infrastructure: Servers, networking hardware, cloud environments, and databases.Energy companies** 

## POTENTIAL RISKS
- ****Data Breach**
- **Infrastructure compromise**
- **Supply chain attack**
- **Cyberattack**
- **Natural Disaster**
- **Employee Negligence****
  
## 3.0 Defense Strategy Against APT34
To mitigate risks, the following multi-layered security measures are recommended:

**A. Network Security**
1.	**Network Segmentation**: Restrict access between critical systems and general networks.
2.	**Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)**: Deploy systems to detect and block unusual traffic patterns and known APT34 signatures.
3.	**DNS Filtering:** Block known malicious domains associated with APT34’s infrastructure.

**B. Endpoint Security**
1.	**Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Monitor endpoints for suspicious activity.
2.	**Regular Patching**: Ensure timely updates of software to address vulnerabilities.
3.	**Application Whitelisting**: Prevent unauthorised execution of applications or scripts.

**C.Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
1.	**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for all critical accounts.
2.	**Least Privilege Access**: Apply the principle of least privilege to minimise access.
3.	**Account Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual login attempts or privilege escalations.

**D. Email Security**
1.	**Anti-Phishing Solutions**: Use tools to detect and block phishing emails.
2.	**User Training:** Educate employees to recognise and report phishing attempts.

**E. Threat Intelligence and Monitoring**
1.	**Threat Feeds**: Monitor threat intelligence feeds for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to APT34.
2.	**Penetration Testing:** Simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities in defences.

**F. Incident Response and Recovery**
1.	**Incident Response Plan**: Develop and routinely test an incident response plan.
2.	**Backup Strategy**: Maintain offline backups to mitigate the impact of data theft or destruction.

**G. Continuous Monitoring and Analytics**
1.	**SIEM Solutions**: Implement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to centralise and correlate logs.
2.	**Behavioural Analytics**: Leverage analytics to detect anomalies indicative of APT-style attacks.

## 4.0 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
APT34’s sophisticated tactics and nation-state backing make it a persistent and formidable threat. The client should:
- Implement the recommended defence strategies to strengthen their security posture.
- Regularly update and test their defenses based on emerging threat intelligence.
- Foster a culture of security awareness among employees to reduce human error.

By adopting these measures, the client can significantly reduce the risk of successful APT34 attacks and enhance resilience against future threat targets. Top Wastage Causes.
